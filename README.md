This website is used at the Faculty of Engineering, Hasanuddin University as a
website to open the parking gate barrier, to find out whether there are any
parking spaces available in real time, and to perform attendance before entering
the laboratory online. This website is also connected to several IoT devices to
monitor temperature and weather conditions, such as whether it is raining or
not.
